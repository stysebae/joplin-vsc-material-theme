# VSCode [Community Material Themes](https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-material-theme) for Joplin

![screenshots](/screenshots/screenshots.gif)
*See [Screenshots](#screenshots) section*

These themes are **flat material themes** for newer version (>= 2.x) of Joplin  desktop application. They are **heavily inspired by the color schemes [Community Material Themes](https://github.com/material-theme/vsc-material-theme) for Visual Studio Code**. 

These themes are modified versions of [joplin-vsc-material-theme](https://github.com/mahor1221/joplin-vsc-material-theme) by [mahor1221](https://github.com/mahor1221). These themes are not longer maintained and not suited for newer versions of Joplin. Here are their updated versions for Joplin >= 2.x.
 
## Installation

Launch Joplin desktop application: 
- Make sure that **Joplin is using the dark mode** in `Tools > Options > Appearance`
- Go to `Tools > Options > Appearance > Show Advanced Settings`. **Paste the content of `userstyle.css` in** the file opened by clicking on the button **"Custom stylesheet for rendered Markdown"**; **paste the content of `userchrome.css` in** the file opened by clicking on the button **"Custom stylesheet for Joplin wide-app styles"**. Alternatively, you can also clone this repository and create symbolic links to `userchrome.css` and `userstyle.css` inside Joplin configuration folder (e.g. in `~/.config/joplin-desktop` on Linux). `userchrome.css` and `userstyle.css` files can be found in one of the folders of this repository, depending on the theme you would like to install.

## Customization

Notes: 
- Please visit the topic [Share your CSS](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/share-your-css/1730) on Joplin's forum. There are some tweaks you might be interested in.
- For enhanced customization, you can also download and install the plugin [Joplin Rich Markdown](https://github.com/CalebJohn/joplin-rich-markdown). Then, enable "Add additional CSS classes for enhanced customization" in the plugin settings (`Tools > Options > Rich Markdown`).

### Changing Colors or Police Fonts

**You can easily change the colors or the police fonts by editing the `:root` pseudo-class** in both files `userchrome.css` and `userstyle.css`. `:root` defines all color schemes variables used along the CSS files. 

The themes also use by default the following police fonts: `Fira Sans` and `Roboto Mono`. Be sure that these are installed on your computer or change them by modifying `--font-face` and `--font-mono` in `:root` pseudo-class. 

### Show/Hide Joplin's UI Elements

Some buttons are shown or hidden by default. You can browse `userchrome.css` to identify these elements and to **hide/show them, by adding `display: none !important;` or by removing it respectively**. Here are some examples of such tweaks.

#### Show "All notes" Icon (Sidebar)

By default, this icon is hidden. You can show it by comment or remove the following lines in `userchrome.css`:

```css
/* Hide "All notes" icon */
i.icon-notes {
  display: none !important;
}
```

#### Hide Synchronization Area (Sidebar)

Add `display: none;` to `.sidebar > div:last-of-type` in `userchrome.css`, e.g.:

```css
.sidebar > div:last-of-type {
  display: none; /* Hide the synchronization area */
  background-color: none !important;
}
```

#### Hide the button "New Todo" (Notes List)

If you do not use any todo's with Joplin, you can hide this button by adding the following lines in `userchrome.css`:

```css
div[height="50"] .new-todo-button {
  display: none; /* Hide the button "New todo" */
}
```
